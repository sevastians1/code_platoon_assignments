# Recursion Challenge

A Recursive function is a function that calls itself.  People use it to take a big problem and continuously break it down into smaller problems (Divde and Conquer). This process of feeding into itself continues until there is the desired answer (_sometimes called the base case_) and the whole chain unwinds.

From the [Wikipedia entry on Divide and Conquer Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm):

> In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is an important algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

Recursion has a time and place in programming, but the fact of the matter is that any problem you can solve recursively you can also iteratively. In real life, you probably won't end up using recursion all that often, but sometimes recursion can lead to code that reads much cleaner than a giant 100-line method.

## Things to think about
* Why is recursion a useful technique for solving a big problem?
* What are the limitations of using recursive solutions?
* What types of problems are more suited for simple loops than recursion?
* What is meant by "recursive depth?"
* What is a "stack overflow" (the concept, not the website)?
* Why is that relevant to a recursive problem?

## Challenges
We have executed several exercises iteratively last week. Today we are going to revisit some of those exercises and rewrite them recursively.

Implement the following exercises recursively:

1. Factorial
2. Palindrome
3. 99 bottles
4. Roman Numerals
